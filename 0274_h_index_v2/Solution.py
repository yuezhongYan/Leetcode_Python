        """Find h_index using bucket sort
        Given an array of citations (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, compute the
        researcher's h-index.
        A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each, and the other
        N - h papers have no more than h citations each.

        This algorithm finds h-index by implementing bucket sort.

        1st loop: Traverse citations array.
        This algorithm first creates a bucket, which stores the numbers of occurrences of each citation in
        citations array. Its index numbers are from 0 to n corresponding to each citation from citations
        array with (n + 1) size. The number of occurrences is initially 0. If a citation is greater than
        the size of citations array, then the number of occurrences increments at the highest index of
        buckets array(i.e. the highest index of buckets array is equal to the size of citations array).
        Otherwise, increment the number of occurrences at the index number of buckets array corresponding
        to the citation from citations array.

        2nd loop: Traverse buckets array.
        Then, traverse the buckets array from end to start. Sum up each element from the buckets array.
        The total sum is actually the h-index. If the total sum is greater than or equal to the current
        index of the bucket array, then the h-index is the current index of the bucket array. The reason
        why to traverse from end to start is to find the greatest index.

        e.g., citations = {3, 0, 6, 1, 5}. Then buckets = {1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 2}
                                           bucket index =  0  1  2  3  4  5

        Bucket index corresponds to 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 from citations array. The numbers of occurrences for
        each bucket index are 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 2. buckets[5] = 2 because it increments twice when
        citation = 6 then 5.

        The total time complexity is O(n + n) = O(n), where the first n is the time to traverse citations
        array and the second n is the time to traverse buckets array.
